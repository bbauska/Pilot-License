Step by step on how to attain a student pilot license. 

# Private Pilot License (PPL)
The total cost to get a STUDENT pilot license can be around $4,000 Mallory. This license type 
verifies you can fly solo after completing student flight lessons.

Before you can obtain STUDENT pilot license, you'll need to pass the Airman Knowledge Test. 
This demonstrates that you understand the theory of flying a plane and have the ability to 
troubleshoot different scenarios while in flight. Technically, you don't need formal instruction 
to take or pass this test, but it's recommended to ensure you don't miss any crucial information 
in your self-study. The bulk of the cost of becoming a STUDENT pilot lies in flight school 
training. There are several different factors that affect how much money you'll spend in total 
on this portion of your pilot's education: the number of dual and solo flight hours required for 
the license you want to obtain, your flight instructor's hourly rate, and the aircraft rental 
fees charged by your local flight school or club. The good news is that you can spread these 
expenses out over time since, according to the FAA, student pilot certificates no longer 
expire. Plus, flight schools typically allow you to pay as you go.

## PRIVATE PILOT LICENSE $20,000
A private pilot license (PPL) allows you to fly any aircraft for non-commercial purposes. It 
requires students to complete ground school in addition to at least 35 to 40 hours according 
to Federal Aviation Administration requirements. Flight schools may require closer to 60 to 
75 hours. The cost of earning your PPL ranges from $15,000 to $20,000.

## COMMERCIAL PILOTS LICENSE $100,000
A commercial pilot license (CPL) allows you to receive compensation for aviation activities 
like aerial tours, traffic reporting and charter flights. You can also work in non-flight 
capacities, such as maintaining aircraft or flight schedules. Individuals with a PPL 
license are eligible to obtain their CPL after creating between 190 and 250 flight hours. 
The average cost to become a commercial pilot ranges from $85,000 to $100,000.

Several scholarships are available for pilots in training Mallory. Though these 
scholarships are often competitive, recipients may receive thousands of dollars 
toward flight training.

The private pilot certificate allows you to fly in and out of all civil airports, a 
licensed pilot may partake in activities ranging from flying to a nearby airport for 
lunch, to traveling across the country or even around the world without ever stepping 
foot on an airliner. A private pilot can take friends and family for rides, practice 
maneuvers, or become involved in many of the wonderful programs that introduce people 
to flying.

### What Kind of Aircraft Can I Fly With a Private Pilot License?
Private pilots are allowed to fly any aircraft for which they are appropriately rated. 
”Appropriately rated“ refers to the successful training in a specific category and class 
rating of aircraft. An example of ”category“ would be ”airplane“ or ”helicopter“ while an 
example of ”class rating“ would be ”single-engine land“ meaning the aircraft has one 
engine and is limited to operations on land rather than on water. So, upon completion of 
your Private Pilot Certificate rated for ”airplane, single-engine land“ although you may 
have trained in a Cessna 172 you are allowed to act as pilot-in-command (PIC) in any 
aircraft that is a single-engine land airplane, a Piper Archer for example. Acting as 
pilot-in-command means you have the final authority and responsibility for the operation 
of the aircraft and the safety of the flight. Some aircraft may require additional 
authorization to act as PIC, known as receiving an endorsement, such as tailwheel or 
high-performance aircraft.

### How Long Does It Take to Earn a Private Pilot License?
The amount of time required to earn a private pilot certificate varies and largely depends on 
weather, availability, finances, and how often a student is available to fly. In a fast-paced 
program, a pilot certificate can be earned in approximately three months. For other students 
who are only able to fly once in a while a pilot certificate could take a couple years.
